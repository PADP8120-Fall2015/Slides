# Course Overview

## Lecture Goals

Students will be able to:

- Describe the course goals
- Explain why this course might be different from what they expected
- Summarize the expectations we have for them this semester

# What is this course?

## What is this course?

Data analysis and statistical inference, not just *statistics*

## Traditional statistics class

## Credit for ALL work

- Courses like this are two classes (computing + statistics) in one, but often you only get training in statistics

- In this class you will receive training in (and credit for) your work on data analysis *and* statistical inference.  

- Labs and assignments will have built-in applied components

## Goals for this course

By the end of the semester, you will:

- Be well-versed in the foundations of statistical inference, including probability, distributions, and hypothesis testing
- Be able to conduct, interpret, and communicate results from multiple regression (including dummy variables and interactions)
- Feel empowered working with data
- Write clean, reusable, and reliable R code

## Overarching goal

- In an MPA class, we try to create "discerning consumers" of statistical analyses

- This course will (start to) train you to be a producer of statistical knowledge through:
    - data procurement and cleaning
    - data visualization
    - statistical modeling
    - presentation and discussion

Everything part of this course is intended to fit this mission. 


## My overall goals

I want this course:

- to be modern 
- to be active and fun (?!?)
- useful for your research and your career goals
- equip you to learn new statistics and new programming on your own

# Statistics

## How I view statistics

My first graduate-level quantitative training was in fisheries:

- Statistics as a toolkit
- Model building: Emphasis is on usefullness, not correctness
- Standard statistical approaches use **models** to draw inference

"All models are wrong, some are useful" - George Box


## Statistical Toolbox

My hope is to give you a foundation so that you can:

- Learn new methods to address questions that you are interested in
- Be creative - know the rules and break them when needed!
- Avoid being a "hammer"

## How NOT to view statistics

It easy easy to be at one of two poles: 

- cynicism: "Lies, damn lies, and statistics!"

- dogmatism: "Numbers = Truth" (or at least "Numbers will tell us what to do...")

Important to bear in mind the "objective people can look at the same evidence and come to divergent, but equally legitimate, opinions" (Sarewitz 2000)

## We will emphasize

- pragmatism

- usefullness

- healthy skepticism

- creativity

Don't let perfect be the enemy of good!

# Inspirations for this class

## Inspirations for this class

- open and reproducible research
- data science
- MOOCs (massively open online courses)
- Open Intro Statistics
- Courses by Matthew Salganik (Princeton), Jenny Bryan (UBC), and Tyler McCormick (UW)

## open and reproducible research

- you will be able to reproduce your own work
- you will be comfortable having your work seen by others
- we will use tools that are available to everyone in the world

## data science

## 

- By the time you are on the job market, computers will be 10x faster than they are now.  

- More importantly, you are not being trained as a CSE grad or in advanced statistical computing. 

- The trick is ride this wave rather than getting crushed by it.

We aren't going to invent new methods or become the best coders, and that is okay!

## MOOCs

- use the great educational materials that exist
- curation vs creation
- contribute to the commons

## Open Intro

- Open source textbook and course materials

- Freely available

- You'll be seeing a bit of open intro


# tools

## tools

- R
- RStudio
- RMarkdown
- dplyr
- ggplot2
- tidyr
- magritrr
- git
- github

all either free or open-source (or both)

## tools

- Better tools mean qualitatively different research, not just the same thing faster

- Many of the tools we'll use are designed to help hackers like use leverage high powered (but more complicated) tools

# Expectations

## 

Six main things you have to do:
 
- prepare for class by reading
- come to class
- engage in class discussions
- ask questions and seek help when needed
- do your labs and homework assignments
- finish the final project

## Homework

There will be 5 homework assignments. 

They will require a mix of data manipulation, statistical analysis, and critical assessment. 

## Homeworks

Submitted in R Markdown via github

We will talk about what that means


## Final Project

Your final project will be a 5-10 page paper that analyzes a topic of your choosing.

- We will talk more about details/specifics
- Intent is to: (1) Allow you to test the skills you learn in this course in a realistic application; (2) At the very least be the genesis for a conference poster/paper or journal article. 

## Tests

- Mid term and final, both take-home

- Open book, intended to function like a lab or research project

- Work by yourself, but can use textbooks, course materials, and the Google


## Discussion

We will have a weekly discussion on pre-assigned readings

- Two students will be assigned to lead discussion each week

- Every student is required to come prepared with 1-pager (2-3 discussion questions, important notes or thoughts - I won't be checking length or anything)

# Course style

## This is what the course should feel like

## Collaboration

- Work together
- Use the Google
- Use stackoverflow
- Practice

## Computing logistics

- How many have laptops? Mac, Windows, Linux?


## Class logistics

General format each week:

- Lecture
- Discussion
- Lab

Ratio of each will vary week-to-week


## Reading

- Class will be WAY better if read the assigned material *before* class
- Class discussion will be based on the readings
- But I know that are all busy adults...

## Attendance

The same thing goes for attendance...

- You are expected to be in class
- Consistently missing discussions and labs will significantly impact your grade

## Honest talk

- I anticipate that this course will seem challenging and fast paced
- I know not all of you think of yourself as "quants", but all of you can learn this material
- I expect to learn a lot in this course as well
- We will help each other with things like good code writing
