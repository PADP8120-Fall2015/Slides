Data manipulation and visualization are often afterthoughts, but shouldn't be!

## 

After this class students will be able to:

- distinguish between the two main purposes of visualizations
- explain the layered grammer of graphics
- be excited to struggle with `ggplot2`

## Why are we doing this?

Visualization is important both for

- learning about your data
- communicating the results of your analyses

Models and tables are fine, but often I find that visualizations are more helpful for understanding what is going on (plus they make your presentations look WAY cooler)

# Examples 

# visualizations for learning

## 

4 data sets with the same regression results: $y = 3 + 0.5 x$

- Red curve shows the global mean temperature, according HadCRUT4 data from 1850 onwards
- Blue curve is the original hockey stick of Mann, Bradley and Hughes (1999) with its uncertainty range (light blue).

Next example from the wonderful paper:

- Kasetellec and Leoni (2007) [Using Graphs Instead of Tables in Political Science](http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707072209)
- They also have a [code respository](http://tables2graphs.com/doku.php)

- When was the last time you saw a table of regression results in a talk?
- When was the last time you saw a graph likes these in a talk?
- Which do you want to have in your talk?

# making graphs

## graphing in R

- base graphics by Ross Ihaka: model is paper and pencil (no grammar)
- grid graphics by Paul Murrell
- lattice graphics by Deepayan Sarkar
- ggplot2 by Hadley Wickham (based on Wilkinson)

## note on coding error

<img src="images/healy_data_2014_fig5.png" width="400">

Thank you to Kieran Healy for being open about this so that we can all learn from it

## note on coding error { .build }

```{r eval=FALSE}
corrplot(c.mat, method="shade", shade.col=NA, tl.col="black",
         order="hclust", hclust.method="ward", tl.srt=45)

corrplot(c.mat,add=TRUE, type="lower", method="number",
         order="AOE", diag=FALSE, tl.pos="n", cl.pos="n")
```


How could you write this differently?

## note on coding error

Don't repeat yourself

```{r eval=FALSE}
data.to.plot <- c.mat
kHclustMethod <- "ward"
kOrder <- "hclust"

corrplot(data.to.plot, method = "shade", shade.col = NA, tl.col = "black",
         order = kOrder, hclust.method = kHclustMethod, 
         tl.srt = 45)

corrplot(data.to.plot, add = TRUE, type = "lower", method = "number",
         order = kOrder, hclust.method = kHclustMethod, 
         diag = FALSE, tl.pos = "n", cl.pos = "n")
```


## ggplot2

Why `ggplot2`?

- based on a grammar
- excellent faceting (especially compared to base R)
- integrates well with `dplyr` and the tidy data philosophy
- lots of add-ons: `ggalley` and `ggmaps`
- natural transition to `ggvis`, the next big thing
- strong and active community

## New York 311 data, Nicole Pangborn

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(ggmap)
library(ggplot2)
NYC <- get_map(location = "new york, new york", zoom = 11)
p <- ggmap(NYC)
p + geom_point(aes(x = dfcalls_small$Longitude, y = dfcalls_small$Latitude)) +
  labs(title = "311 calls in NYC, 1/28/15 - 1/29/15") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=rel(2)))
```

## 

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
library(ggplot2)
packageVersion("ggplot2")
```

##

Next, an example based on [Dawn Koffman's OPR workshop](http://opr.princeton.edu/workshops/201501/)

## 

Basic components:

- default dataset and set of mappings from variables to aesthetics
- one or more layers

## 

```{r}
world.pop.data <- read.csv("data/wdata.csv", head = TRUE, sep = ",")
world.pop.data <- tbl_df(world.pop.data)
```

```{r}
glimpse(world.pop.data)
```

##

```{r}
world.pop.data
```

##

All together, the layered grammar defines a plot as the combination of:

- A default dataset and set of mappings from variables to aesthetics.
- One or more layers, each composed of a geometric object, a statistical
transformation, and a position adjustment, and optionally, a dataset and
aesthetic mappings.
- One scale for each aesthetic mapping.
- A coordinate system.
- The faceting specification.

Questions about visualization and ggplot2?

One thing that you should know that most people don't talk about:

- you will build and tweak your graphs over time; the first graph is never the final graph

Goal check

Review and motivation for next class

## going forward

- `ggplot2` is confusing at first
- but it will make you powerful

It just takes practice!
