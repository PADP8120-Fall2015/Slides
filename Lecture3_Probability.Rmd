#Probability

## Different thinking about probability leads to different styles of inference

Two broad categories: Frequentist and Bayesian

## Frequentist

1. Frequency probability: the long run proportion of
 times an event occurs in independent, identically distributed 
 repetitions.
2. Frequency inference: the use of frequentist probability
to control error rates. Answers questions like "What should I decide
given my data controlling the long run proportion of mistakes I make at
a tolerable level."

## Bayesian

1. Bayesian probability: the probability calculus of beliefs, given that beliefs follow certain rules.
2. Bayesian inference: the use of Bayesian probability representation
of beliefs to perform inference. Answers questions like "Given my subjective beliefs and the objective information from the data, what
should I believe now?"

## What am I/are we?

In 8120, we will be focus on basic probability models and frequentist-style analyses

Most people tend to fall somewhere in the middle: both are tools to be used where appropriate

## Probability

Given a random experiment (say rolling a die) a probability measure is a population quantity that summarizes the randomness.

Specifically, probability takes a possible outcome from the expertiment and assigns it a number between 0 and 1 so that the probability that something occurs is 1 (the die must be rolled) and so that the probability of the union of any two sets of outcomes that have nothing in common is the sum of their respective probabilities.


## Notation

- The **sample space**, $\Omega$, is the collection of possible outcomes of an experiment
  - Example: die roll $\Omega = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$
- An **event**, say $E$, is a subset of $\Omega$ 
  - Example: die roll is even $E = \{2,4,6\}$
- An **elementary** or **simple** event is a particular result
  of an experiment
  - Example: die roll is a four, $\omega = 4$
- $\emptyset$ is called the **null event** or the **empty set**

## Interpretation of set operations

Normal set operations have particular interpretations in this setting

1. $\omega \in E$ implies that $E$ occurs when $\omega$ occurs
2. $\omega \not\in E$ implies that $E$ does not occur when $\omega$ occurs
3. $E \subset F$ implies that the occurrence of $E$ implies the occurrence of $F$
4. $E \cap F$  implies the event that both $E$ and $F$ occur
5. $E \cup F$ implies the event that at least one of $E$ or $F$ occur
6. $E \cap F=\emptyset$ means that $E$ and $F$ are **mutually exclusive**, or cannot both occur
7. $E^c$ or $\bar E$ is the event that $E$ does not occur

## Probability (now with symbols)
A **probability measure**, $P$, is a function from the collection of possible events so that the following hold

1. For an event $E\subset \Omega$, $0 \leq P(E) \leq 1$
2. $P(\Omega) = 1$
3. If $E_1$ and $E_2$ are mutually exclusive events
  $P(E_1 \cup E_2) = P(E_1) + P(E_2)$.

Part 3 of the definition implies **finite additivity**

$$
P(\cup_{i=1}^n A_i) = \sum_{i=1}^n P(A_i)
$$
where the $\{A_i\}$ are mutually exclusive.

## Example consequences

- $P(\emptyset) = 0$
- $P(E) = 1 - P(E^c)$
- $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$
- if $A \sub

## Example

The National Sleep Foundation (www.sleepfoundation.org) reports that around 3% of the American population has sleep apnea. They also report that around 10% of the North American and European population has restless leg syndrome. Does this imply that 13% of people will have at least one sleep problems of these sorts?

## Example continued

Answer: No, the events are not mutually exclusive. To elaborate let:

$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
    A_1 & = & \{\mbox{Person has sleep apnea}\} \\
    A_2 & = & \{\mbox{Person has RLS}\} 
  \end{eqnarray*}
$$

Then 

$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
    P(A_1 \cup A_2 ) & = & P(A_1) + P(A_2) - P(A_1 \cap A_2) \\
   & = & 0.13 - \mbox{Probability of having both}
  \end{eqnarray*}
$$
Likely, some fraction of the population has both.

set B$ then $P(A) \leq P(B)$
- $P\left(A \cup B\right) = 1 - P(A^c \cap B^c)$
- $P(A \cap B^c) = P(A) - P(A \cap B)$
- $P(\cup_{i=1}^n E_i) \leq \sum_{i=1}^n P(E_i)$
- $P(\cup_{i=1}^n E_i) \geq \max_i P(E_i)$


# Independence and Conditionality

## Independent events

- Two events $A$ and $B$ are **independent** if $$P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$$
- Two random variables, $X$ and $Y$ are independent if for any two sets $A$ and $B$ $$P([X \in A] \cap [Y \in B]) = P(X\in A)P(Y\in B)$$
- If $A$ is independent of $B$ then 

  - $A^c$ is independent of $B$ 
  - $A$ is independent of $B^c$
  - $A^c$ is independent of $B^c$


## Example

- What is the probability of getting two consecutive heads?
- $A = \{\mbox{Head on flip 1}\}$ ~ $P(A) = .5$
- $B = \{\mbox{Head on flip 2}\}$ ~ $P(B) = .5$
- $A \cap B = \{\mbox{Head on flips 1 and 2}\}$
- $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B) = .5 \times .5 = .25$ 


## Conditional probability

- The probability of getting a one when rolling a (standard) die
  is usually assumed to be one sixth
- Suppose you were given the extra information that the die roll
  was an odd number (hence 1, 3 or 5)
- *conditional on this new information*, the probability of a
  one is now one third


## Conditional probability, definition

- Let $B$ be an event so that $P(B) > 0$
- Then the conditional probability of an event $A$ given that $B$ has occurred is
  $$
  P(A ~|~ B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
  $$
- Notice that if $A$ and $B$ are independent, then
  $$
  P(A ~|~ B) = \frac{P(A) P(B)}{P(B)} = P(A)
  $$


## Example

- Consider our die roll example
- $B = \{1, 3, 5\}$
- $A = \{1\}$
$$
  \begin{eqnarray*}
P(\mbox{one given that roll is odd})  & = & P(A ~|~ B) \\ \\
  & = & \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \\ \\
  & = & \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} \\ \\ 
  & = & \frac{1/6}{3/6} = \frac{1}{3}
  \end{eqnarray*}
$$


# Bayes' Theorem: When probability isn't intuitive

## Bayes' rule

$$
P(B ~|~ A) = \frac{P(A ~|~ B) P(B)}{P(A ~|~ B) P(B) + P(A ~|~ B^c)P(B^c)}.
$$
  

## Example: Diagnostic tests

- Let $+$ and $-$ be the events that the result of a diagnostic test is positive or negative respectively
- Let $D$ and $D^c$ be the event that the subject of the test has or does not have the disease respectively 
- The **sensitivity** is the probability that the test is positive given that the subject actually has the disease, $P(+ ~|~ D)$
- The **specificity** is the probability that the test is negative given that the subject does not have the disease, $P(- ~|~ D^c)$


## More definitions

- The **positive predictive value** is the probability that the subject has the  disease given that the test is positive, $P(D ~|~ +)$
- The **negative predictive value** is the probability that the subject does not have the disease given that the test is negative, $P(D^c ~|~ -)$
- The **prevalence of the disease** is the marginal probability of disease, $P(D)$


## More definitions

- The **diagnostic likelihood ratio of a positive test**, labeled $DLR_+$, is $P(+ ~|~ D) / P(+ ~|~ D^c)$, which is the $$sensitivity / (1 - specificity)$$
- The **diagnostic likelihood ratio of a negative test**, labeled $DLR_-$, is $P(- ~|~ D) / P(- ~|~ D^c)$, which is the $$(1 - sensitivity) / specificity$$


## Example

- A study comparing the efficacy of HIV tests, reports on an experiment which concluded that HIV antibody tests have a sensitivity of 99.7% and a specificity of 98.5%
- Suppose that a subject, from a population with a .1% prevalence of HIV, receives a positive test result. What is the probability that this subject has HIV?
- Mathematically, we want $P(D ~|~ +)$ given the sensitivity, $P(+ ~|~ D) = .997$, the specificity, $P(- ~|~ D^c) =.985$, and the prevalence $P(D) = .001$


## Using Bayes' formula

$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
  P(D ~|~ +) & = &\frac{P(+~|~D)P(D)}{P(+~|~D)P(D) + P(+~|~D^c)P(D^c)}\\ \\
 & = & \frac{P(+~|~D)P(D)}{P(+~|~D)P(D) + \{1-P(-~|~D^c)\}\{1 - P(D)\}} \\ \\
 & = & \frac{.997\times .001}{.997 \times .001 + .015 \times .999}\\ \\
 & = & .062
\end{eqnarray*}
$$

- In this population a positive test result only suggests a 6% probability that the subject has the disease 
- (The positive predictive value is 6% for this test)


## More on this example

- The low positive predictive value is due to low prevalence of disease and the somewhat modest specificity
- Suppose it was known that the subject was an intravenous drug user and routinely had intercourse with an HIV infected partner
- Notice that the evidence implied by a positive test result does not change because of the prevalence of disease in the subject's population, only our interpretation of that evidence changes
 
  
## Likelihood ratios

- Using Bayes rule, we have
  $$
  P(D ~|~ +) = \frac{P(+~|~D)P(D)}{P(+~|~D)P(D) + P(+~|~D^c)P(D^c)} 
  $$
  and
  $$
  P(D^c ~|~ +) = \frac{P(+~|~D^c)P(D^c)}{P(+~|~D)P(D) + P(+~|~D^c)P(D^c)}.
  $$


## Likelihood ratios

- Therefore
$$
\frac{P(D ~|~ +)}{P(D^c ~|~ +)} = \frac{P(+~|~D)}{P(+~|~D^c)}\times \frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)}
$$
ie
$$
\mbox{post-test odds of }D = DLR_+\times\mbox{pre-test odds of }D
$$
- Similarly, $DLR_-$ relates the decrease in the odds of the
  disease after a negative test result to the odds of disease prior to
  the test.


## HIV example continued

- Suppose a subject has a positive HIV test
- $DLR_+ = .997 / (1 - .985) \approx 66$
- The result of the positive test is that the odds of disease is now 66 times the pretest odds
- Or, equivalently, the hypothesis of disease is 66 times more supported by the data than the hypothesis of no disease


## HIV example continued

- Suppose that a subject has a negative test result 
- $DLR_- = (1 - .997) / .985  \approx .003$
- Therefore, the post-test odds of disease is now $.3\%$ of the pretest odds given the negative test.
- Or, the hypothesis of disease is supported $.003$ times that of the hypothesis of absence of disease given the negative test result

# Wrap up

##
-Right now, much of what we have covered today likely seems a bit abstract. 

-However, the basic tenets of probability that we have covered today are the building blocks for all of the advanced work to come

-Much of our research comes down to comparing probabilities: What is more likely, A or B?
